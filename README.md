# libaji - one library, all your need!

__libaji__ is a library for all features you need. It works just like 
a charm.

To use this library, there are three ways to do.

 1. You can just clone the repo and build it by yourself and link 
it in your program. This way seems a little complex.
 2. You can ask me to do it. pay me $10000000 and I will help you.
 3. You can use TejiLang for automaticly import. but, TejiLang 
itself can do anything you want, why you still need this lib?

# Our users!
